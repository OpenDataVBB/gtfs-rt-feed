If there is no _Price_, the _Developer_ nonetheless expects the _User_ to rely on this license nonetheless, and will not revoke it unless the _User_ breaks one of its rules.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe **Licensed Contributions** are the contributions the _Developer_ has made to the _Project_ with the _Offer Identifier_ in metadata, as well as any contributions the _Developer_ makes to the _Project_ in the future without changing the _Offer Identifier_ or adding a new one. _Licensed Contributions_ do not include any contributions the _Developer_ makes to the project in the future with a different or additional identifier.\n\n## Copyright\n\nThe _Developer_ licenses the _User_ for the _Term_ to do everything with the _Licensed Contributions_ that would otherwise infringe the _Developer_'s copyright in them.\n\n## Patent\n\nThe _Developer_ licenses the _User_ for the _Term_ to do everything with the _Project_ that would otherwise infringe patent claims the _Developer_ can license or becomes able to license.\n\n## Sublicensing\n\nIf the _User_ combines some or all of the _Licensed Contributions_ with other software in a larger application, the _User_ may pass on their license rights, or sublicense, those _Licensed Contributions_ as part of their larger application, and allow further sublicensing in turn, under the following rules:\n\n### Value\n\nThe larger application must have significant additional content or functionality beyond that of the _Project_, and end users must license the larger application primarily for that added content or functionality.\n\n### Maintenance\n\nThe _User_ may sublicense others to maintain the larger application, but not to use the _Licensed Contributions_ in new or different ways in that application, or to develop larger applications of their own.\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe purpose of [Value](#value) and [Maintenance](#maintenance) is to prevent the _User_ from sublicensing others who should buy their own private licenses.\n\n### Terms\n\n[Sublicensing](#sublicensing) and [Notices](#notices), as well as warranty disclaimers and damages exclusions at least as broad as [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) and [Exclusion](#exclusion), must apply to each sublicense.\n\n### Unlimited Applications\n\nThe _User_ may build, and sublicense for, as many larger applications as they like.\n\n## Notices\n\nIn order to make sure that everyone who gets a copy of the _Licensed Contributions_ knows about the license terms for their use, the _Developer_ agrees to give everyone who gets a copy of some or all of the _Licensed Contributions_ from them, with or without changes, the text of this license and any public license for the _Licensed Contributions_.\n\n## Agency\n\nThe _Developer_ has authorized the _Agent_ to sign this license on the _Developer_'s behalf. The _Agent_ is not a party to this license.\n\n## Guarantee\n\nThe _Developer_ guarantees that they either own or have the rights to license copyrights in the _Licensed Contributions_, and are aware that legal rules and agreements can make others the owners of copyrights in their work.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n!!! With the sole exception of [Guarantee](#guarantee), as far as the law allows, the _Project_ comes as is, without any warranty or condition.\n\n## Exclusion\n\n!!! With the sole exception of [Guarantee](#guarantee), as far as the law allows, neither the _Developer_ nor their _Agent_ will be liable to anyone for any damages related to the _Project_ or this license, under any kind of legal claim.\n",
